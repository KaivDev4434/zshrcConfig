# zshrcConfig

A lean, **plugin-free Z shell configuration** focused on instant start-up time while still delivering modern ergonomics through Starship, Zoxide, Cond and Linuxbrew integration.  
Copy the `.zshrc` from this repository to any macOS / Linux box, install the listed prerequisites, and you’ll get:

* a fast, fully-featured prompt (Starship)  
* one-keystroke directory jumping (`z`, `zi`, `za`, … via Zoxide)  
* automatic `conda` environment support  
* Homebrew/Linuxbrew environment wiring for seamless package management  
* a clean starting point you can extend with Oh-My-Zsh or other frameworks if you ever need them.

## Repository layout

| Path   | Purpose                                     |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| `.zshrc` | Complete configuration (≈ 140 LOC) including Conda initialisation, Zoxide helpers, Starship and Linuxbrew shell-env setup.[1] |

There are **no other files** – the whole setup lives in a single, easy-to-audit dot-file.

## Prerequisites

1. **Z shell ≥ 5.7** – already the default on macOS and most modern Linux distros.  
2. **Starship prompt** – universal, themeable prompt:  
   ```bash
   brew install starship    # Mac / Linuxbrew
   sudo pacman -S starship   # Arch
   ```
3. **Zoxide** – smarter `cd` replacement:  
   ```bash
   brew install zoxide
   ```
4. **Conda** (optional) – customise the hard-coded path in the file to match your installation if you use Miniconda/Anaconda.[1]
5. **Linuxbrew / Homebrew** (optional) – only needed if you want the automatic `$PATH` wiring from `brew shellenv`.[1]

> Tip: install a Nerd Font (e.g. FiraCode NF) so Starship can display all glyphs correctly.[2]

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Get the config
git clone https://github.com/KaivDev4434/zshrcConfig.git
cp zshrcConfig/.zshrc ~/.zshrc

# 2. Install prerequisites (example using Linuxbrew)
brew install starship zoxide

# 3. Restart the shell
exec zsh
```

That’s it – you should immediately see the colourful Starship prompt and be able to type `z` followed by a fragment of a directory name to jump there.

## Key features explained

### 1. Blazing-fast prompt (Starship)
Starship is initialised with  
```zsh
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```
giving you a minimal yet information-rich prompt that renders in milliseconds.[1]

### 2. Effortless navigation (Zoxide)
The config defines convenience wrappers around Zoxide commands[1]:

| Command | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| `z <pattern>` | Jump to the most likely directory matching *pattern*. |
| `zi <pattern>` | Interactive fuzzy-finder over Zoxide database. |
| `za`  | Manually add current directory to the database. |
| `zq`, `zqi` | Query database (non-cd). |
| `zr`, `zri` | Remove entries. |

A hook adds every directory you visit into the Zoxide database automatically (`chpwd_functions+=( _zoxide_hook )`).[1]

### 3. Conda auto-activation
The block generated by `conda init` ensures that any `conda activate env` command works out of the box and that `$PATH` is configured even if the hook fails.[1]

### 4. Linuxbrew / Homebrew integration
```zsh
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
injects Linuxbrew’s `bin`, `sbin`, `include` and `lib` paths so that packages you install later are found first on the `$PATH`.[1]

### 5. Oh-My-Zsh ready (but optional)
All Oh-My-Zsh lines (`ZSH=…`, `plugins=(git)`, `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh` and theme settings) are **commented out**.  
Uncomment them to enable the framework without touching the rest of the file.[1]

## Customisation tips

1. **Change prompt look** – create `~/.config/starship.toml` (see Starship docs[2]) and tweak modules, colours or add a newline.
2. **Update Conda path** – replace every `/home/ill_pickle/jupyterNote/anaconda3` with your actual install location.[1]
3. **Add aliases / functions** – append below the “User configuration” section; nothing will be overridden on update.
4. **Enable Oh-My-Zsh plugins** – uncomment the block and list any additional plugins, e.g. `plugins=(git z zsh-autosuggestions)`.[3]

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| “command not found: starship” | Install Starship (see prerequisites) or comment out its init line. |
| `z` returns “zoxide: command not found” | Ensure Zoxide is installed and on your `$PATH`. |
| Conda envs not activating | Run `conda init zsh` again or adjust the hard-coded path. |
| Slow startup after enabling Oh-My-Zsh | Limit the number of plugins; each plugin adds overhead.[4][3] |
